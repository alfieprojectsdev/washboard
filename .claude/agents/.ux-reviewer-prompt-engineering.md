# Prompt Engineering Techniques Applied to ux-reviewer.md

This document describes the prompt engineering patterns from `prompt-engineering.md` that were applied to the ux-reviewer agent.

## Techniques Applied

### 1. **Emphasis Hierarchy** (RULE 0 Pattern)
**Location:** Line 18
```markdown
## RULE 0 (MOST IMPORTANT): Focus on user impact
```

**Why:** Establishes clear priority system matching other agents (architect, developer, quality-reviewer)
**Expected Impact:** Agent immediately understands the single most important constraint (user impact over aesthetics)

---

### 2. **Reward/Penalty Gamification**
**Location:** Lines 19, 168
```markdown
(-$1000 penalty for flagging style preferences)
```

**Why:** Reinforces behavioral boundaries through negative consequences
**Expected Impact:** Prevents subjective "this would look nicer" suggestions without measurable user impact
**Pattern Source:** BashTool uses "-$1000" penalty for sandbox misuse; quality-reviewer uses this pattern

---

### 3. **Progressive Disclosure**
**Location:** Lines 24-61 (Issue Categories)

**Structure:**
- First: Critical issues (MUST FLAG - accessibility barriers)
- Then: Important issues (WORTH RAISING - degraded experience)
- Finally: What to ignore (IGNORE - subjective preferences)

**Why:** Guides agent from highest to lowest priority concerns
**Expected Impact:** Agent evaluates most critical issues first, filters out noise
**Pattern Source:** Read tool prompt uses progressive detail (basic → default → advanced → edge cases)

---

### 4. **Categorical Grouping with Examples**
**Location:** Lines 26-61

**Pattern:**
```markdown
### MUST FLAG (Accessibility Barriers)
1. **WCAG Violations**
   - Missing alt text
   - Insufficient color contrast
   - Missing keyboard navigation
```

**Why:** Explicit categorization prevents ambiguity about what constitutes a critical issue
**Expected Impact:** Agent can quickly classify issues into priority buckets
**Pattern Source:** BashTool categorizes commands by type (file ops, network, build systems)

---

### 5. **Negative Examples (Anti-Patterns)**
**Location:** Lines 167-174 (NEVER Do These)

**Pattern:**
```markdown
## NEVER Do These
- NEVER flag style preferences without user impact (-$1000 penalty)
- NEVER suggest "nicer" designs without usability rationale
- NEVER review without being asked
```

**Why:** Explicit forbidden behaviors prevent common failure modes
**Expected Impact:** Blocks agent from becoming a "design critic" instead of UX reviewer
**Pattern Source:** Git commit workflow uses "NEVER update the git config", "DO NOT push"

---

### 6. **Positive Examples (Required Patterns)**
**Location:** Lines 176-183 (ALWAYS Do These)

**Pattern:**
```markdown
## ALWAYS Do These
- ALWAYS check WCAG 2.1 AA compliance minimum
- ALWAYS verify keyboard navigation works
- ALWAYS provide specific file:line locations
```

**Why:** Establishes mandatory checklist for every review
**Expected Impact:** Ensures consistency across all UX reviews, no steps skipped
**Pattern Source:** Developer agent uses ALWAYS pattern for conventions and error handling

---

### 7. **Specific Output Format with Examples**
**Location:** Lines 102-155 (Review Format)

**Pattern:**
```markdown
### For Simple UI Changes
\```
**Accessibility Issues:**
- [file:line] Missing alt text for avatar image
**Usability Issues:**
- [file:line] Delete button has no confirmation
\```
```

**Why:** Concrete examples prevent vague feedback
**Expected Impact:** Standardized output format across all UX reviews, easy to parse
**Pattern Source:** Architect agent provides specific output templates for simple/complex designs

---

### 8. **Conditional Workflow**
**Location:** Line 360-372 (plan-execution.md integration)

**Pattern:**
```markdown
### 2. UX Review (If UI Changes)
```

**Why:** Only trigger UX review when relevant (UI implementation)
**Expected Impact:** Prevents unnecessary UX reviews for backend-only changes
**Pattern Source:** Conditional tool instructions (JupyterSupport based on environment variables)

---

### 9. **Scope Limitation**
**Location:** Lines 8, 171

**Pattern:**
```markdown
You review UI implementations when requested.
- NEVER review without being asked
```

**Why:** Prevents proactive reviews that would interrupt workflow
**Expected Impact:** Agent waits for explicit delegation before reviewing
**Pattern Source:** Quality-reviewer has "NEVER review without being asked by architect"

---

### 10. **Priority Hierarchy with Blocking Conditions**
**Location:** Lines 185-202 (Priority Levels)

**Pattern:**
```markdown
**P0 (Block release):**
- WCAG A violations
- Complete UX blockers

**P1 (Fix before launch):**
- WCAG AA violations
- Confusing user flows

**P2 (Improve later):**
- Minor usability improvements
```

**Why:** Clear escalation path for issues
**Expected Impact:** Team knows what must be fixed immediately vs. what can wait
**Pattern Source:** Bug priority in debugger agent (memory corruption = highest priority)

---

### 11. **Contextual References to Project Standards**
**Location:** Lines 10-16

**Pattern:**
```markdown
## Project-Specific Standards
ALWAYS check CLAUDE.md for:
- Design system guidelines
- Accessibility requirements (WCAG level)
- Target user personas
```

**Why:** Ensures agent adapts to project-specific requirements
**Expected Impact:** Reviews align with project's accessibility standards (WCAG AA vs AAA)
**Pattern Source:** All agents check CLAUDE.md; architect checks for "Architecture patterns and principles"

---

### 12. **Tool/Resource Reference Section**
**Location:** Lines 157-165

**Pattern:**
```markdown
## Testing Tools Reference
- **Keyboard only** - Tab through entire interface
- **Screen reader** - NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver
- **Browser DevTools** - Lighthouse accessibility audit
```

**Why:** Provides actionable guidance for manual verification
**Expected Impact:** Developer knows exactly how to test findings
**Pattern Source:** Debugger agent references specific tools (valgrind, sanitizers, profilers)

---

## Techniques NOT Applied (Intentionally)

### 1. **Extreme Conciseness**
**Why not:** UX reviews benefit from explanatory context (impact statements, fix suggestions)
**Trade-off:** quality-reviewer is terse; ux-reviewer is explanatory for educational value

### 2. **Parallel Tool Execution**
**Why not:** UX review is primarily analytical, not tool-heavy
**Trade-off:** Git workflows use parallel commands; ux-reviewer uses sequential analysis

### 3. **Meta-Prompting/Sub-Agents**
**Why not:** UX review is leaf-level (doesn't delegate further)
**Trade-off:** plan-execution delegates to agents; ux-reviewer is terminal agent

## Compliance Summary

| Aspect | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Frontmatter format | ✅ | Matches other agents |
| RULE 0 pattern | ✅ | Emphasis hierarchy applied |
| CLAUDE.md integration | ✅ | Project-specific standards section |
| Reward/penalty system | ✅ | -$1000 for style preference flagging |
| NEVER/ALWAYS sections | ✅ | Behavioral constraints explicit |
| Output format examples | ✅ | Concrete templates provided |
| plan-execution.md integration | ✅ | Added to agent list and post-implementation protocol |
| Progressive disclosure | ✅ | Critical → Important → Ignore structure |
| Scope limitation | ✅ | "Review when requested" constraint |
| Priority hierarchy | ✅ | P0/P1/P2 blocking conditions |

---

## Behavioral Impact Predictions

1. **Reduced false positives** - Penalty for style preferences should eliminate subjective suggestions
2. **Consistent output** - Templates ensure uniform format across reviews
3. **Priority clarity** - P0/P1/P2 system gives teams clear action items
4. **Project adaptation** - CLAUDE.md checks allow per-project WCAG level (AA vs AAA)
5. **Tool-assisted verification** - Testing tools reference enables manual validation
6. **Integration with workflow** - plan-execution integration makes UX review automatic for UI changes

---

**Conclusion:** ux-reviewer.md successfully applies 10/12 major prompt engineering patterns from the repository, with intentional omissions based on the agent's analytical (not tool-execution) nature.
